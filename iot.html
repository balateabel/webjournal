APPLICATIONS DEV’T & EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES BS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 3
After accomplishing this chapter, Students will be able to:

➢ Describe IoT
➢ Explain the history of IoT
➢ Describe the pros and cons of IoT
➢ Explain how IoT works
➢ Explain the architecture of IoT
➢ Describe IoT tools and platforms
➢ Describe some of the application areas of IoT

Overview of IoT
The most important features of IoT include artificial intelligence, connectivity, sensors, active
engagement, and small device use. A brief review of these features is given below −
• AI − IoT essentially makes virtually anything “smart”, meaning it enhances every aspect of life
with the power of data collection, artificial intelligence algorithms, and networks. This can mean something
as simple as enhancing your refrigerator and cabinets to detect when milk and your favorite cereal run low,
and to then place an order with your preferred grocer.
• Connectivity − New enabling technologies for networking and specifically IoT networking, mean
networks are no longer exclusively tied to major providers. Networks can exist on a much smaller and
cheaper scale while still being practical. IoT creates these small networks between its system devices.
• Sensors − IoT loses its distinction without sensors. They act as defining instruments that
transform IoT from a standard passive network of devices into an active system capable of real-world
integration.
• Active Engagement − Much of today's interaction with connected technology happens through
passive engagement. IoT introduces a new paradigm for active content, product, or service engagement.
• Small Devices − Devices, as predicted, have become smaller, cheaper, and more powerful over
time. IoT exploits purpose-built small devices to deliver its precision, scalability, and versatility.
What is IoT?
The description of the Internet of Things is related to different definitions used by several groups
for promoting the particular concept in the whole world.
➢ According to the Internet Architecture Board’s (IAB) definition, IoT is the networking of smart
objects, meaning a huge number of devices intelligently communicating in the presence of internet protocol
that cannot be directly operated by human beings but exist as components in buildings, vehicles or the
environment.
➢ According to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) organization’s definition, IoT is the
networking of smart objects in which smart objects have some constraints such as limited bandwidth,
power, and processing accessibility for achieving interoperability among smart objects.
➢ According to the IEEE Communications category magazine’s definition, IoT is a framework of
all things that have a representation in the presence of the internet in such a way that new applications and
services enable the interaction in the physical and virtual world in the form of Machine-to-Machine (M2M)
communication in the cloud.
➢ According to the Oxford dictionary’s definition, IoT is the interaction of everyday object’s
computing devices through the Internet that enables the sending and receiving of useful data.
➢ The term Internet of Things (IoT) according to the 2020 conceptual framework is expressed
through a simple formula such as: IoT= Services+ Data+ Networks + Sensors
Generally, The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded
with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and
exchange data. IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects,
animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network
without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. IoT is a network of devices that can
sense, accumulate and transfer data over the internet without any human intervention.
Simply stated, the Internet of Things consists of any device with an on/off switch connected to the
Internet. This includes almost anything you can think of, ranging from cellphones to building maintenance
to the jet engine of an airplane. Medical devices, such as a heart monitor implant or a biochip transponder
in a farm animal, can transfer data over a network and are members of the IoT. If it has an off/on the switch,
then it can, theoretically, be part of the system. The IoT consists of a gigantic network of internet-connected
“things” and devices. Ring, a doorbell that links to your smartphone, provides an excellent example of a
recent addition to the Internet of Things.
Ring signals you when the doorbell is pressed and lets you see who it is and to speak with them.The
internet of things (IoT) has found its application in several areas such as connected industry, smart-city,

WEEK 4 – INTERNET OF THINGS

APPLICATIONS DEV’T & EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES BS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 3
smart-home, smart-energy, connected car, smart agriculture, connected building and campus, health care,
logistics, among other domains (see Figure 4.1). IoT systems allow users to achieve deeper automation,
analysis, and integration within a system. They improve the reach of these areas and their accuracy.

IoT utilizes existing and emerging technology for sensing, networking, and robotics. IoT exploits
recent advances in software, falling hardware prices, and modern attitudes towards technology. Its new and
advanced elements bring major changes in the delivery of products, goods, and services; and the social,
economic, and political impact of those changes.
History of IoT
The Internet of Things has not been around for very long. However, there have been visions of
machines communicating with one another since the early 1800s. Machines have been providing direct
communications since the telegraph (the first landline) was developed in the 1830s and 1840s. Described
as “wireless telegraphy,” the first radio voice transmission took place on June 3, 1900, providing another
necessary component for developing the Internet of Things. The development of computers began in the
1950s.
The Internet, itself a significant component of the IoT, started out as part of DARPA (Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1962 and evolved into ARPANET in 1969. In the 1980s,
commercial service providers began supporting public use of ARPANET, allowing it to evolve into our
modern Internet. Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) became a reality in early 1993, with the Department
of Defense providing a stable, highly functional system of 24 satellites. This was quickly followed by
privately owned, commercial satellites being placed in orbit. Satellites and landlines provide basic
communications for much of the IoT. One additional and important component in developing a functional
IoT was IPV6’s remarkably intelligent decision to increase address space.
The Internet of Things, as a concept, wasn’t officially named until 1999. One of the first examples
of an Internet of Things is from the early 1980s and was a Coca Cola machine, located at the Carnegie
Melon University. Local programmers would connect by the Internet to the refrigerated appliance, and
check to see if there was a drink available and if it was cold, before making the trip.
By the year 2013, the Internet of Things had evolved into a system using multiple technologies,
ranging from the Internet to wireless communication and from micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)
to embedded systems. The traditional fields of automation (including the automation of buildings and
homes), wireless sensor networks, GPS, control systems, and others, all support the IoT.
Kevin Ashton, the Executive Director of Auto-ID Labs at MIT, was the first to describe the Internet
of Things, during his 1999 speech. Kevin Ashton stated that Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) was a
prerequisite for the Internet of Things. He concluded if all devices were “tagged,” computers could manage,
track, and inventory them. To some extent, the tagging of things has been achieved through technologies
such as digital watermarking, barcodes, and QR codes.
Inventory control is one of the more obvious advantages of the Internet of Things.
IoT − Advantages
The advantages of IoT span across every area of lifestyle and business. Here is a list of some of the
advantages that IoT has to offer:
• Improved Customer Engagement − Current analytics suffer from blind-spots and significant
flaws inaccuracy; and as noted, engagement remains passive. IoT completely transforms this to achieve
richer and more effective engagement with audiences.

WEEK 4 – INTERNET OF THINGS

APPLICATIONS DEV’T & EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES BS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 3
• Technology Optimization − The same technologies and data which improve the customer
experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to technology. IoT unlocks a
world of critical functional and field data.
• Reduced Waste − IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us superficial
insight, but IoT provides real-world information leading to the more effective management of resources.
• Enhanced Data Collection − Modern data collection suffers from its limitations and its design
for passive use. IoT breaks it out of those spaces and places it exactly where humans really want to go to
analyze our world. It allows an accurate picture of everything.
IoT – Disadvantages
Here is a list of some of the disadvantages of IoT. these are:
• As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices,
the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.
• If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device will become corrupted.
• Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s difficult for devices from
different manufacturers to communicate with each other.
• Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers maybe even millions of IoT
devices and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.
Challenges of IoT
Though IoT delivers an impressive set of advantages, it also presents a significant set of challenges.
Here is a list of some its major issues:
• Security − IoT creates an ecosystem of constantly connected devices communicating over
networks. The system offers little control despite any security measures. This leaves users exposed to
various kinds of attackers.
• Privacy − The sophistication of IoT provides substantial personal data in extreme detail without
the user's active participation.
• Complexity − Some find IoT systems complicated in terms of design, deployment, and
maintenance given their use of multiple technologies and a large set of new enabling technologies.
• Flexibility − Many are concerned about the flexibility of an IoT system to integrate easily with
another. They worry about finding themselves with several conflicting or locking systems.
• Compliance − IoT, like any other technology in the realm of business, must comply
withregulations. Its complexity makes the issue of compliance seem incredibly challenging when many
consider standard software compliance a battle.
How does it work?
An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded processors, sensors
and communication hardware to collect, send and act on data they acquire from their environments. IoT
devices share the sensor data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway or another edge device where
data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally.
Sometimes, these devices communicate with other related devices and act on the information they
get from one another. The devices do most of the work without human intervention, although people can
interact with the devices. For instance, to set them up, give them instructions or access the data. The
connectivity, networking and communication protocols used with these web-enabled devices largely
depend on the specific IoT applications deployed.
Architecture of IoT
In general, an IoT device can be explained as a network of things that consists of hardware,
software, network connectivity, and sensors. Hence, the architecture of IoT devices comprises four major
components: sensing, network, data processing, and application layers (as depicted in Figure 4.2). A
detailed description of these layers is given below.
1. Sensing Layer - The main purpose of the sensing layer is to identify any phenomena in the
devices’ peripheral and obtain data from the real world. This layer consists of several sensors.
Using multiple sensors for applications is one of the primary features of IoT devices. Sensors in
IoT devices are usually integrated through sensor hubs.

WEEK 4 – INTERNET OF THINGS

APPLICATIONS DEV’T & EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES BS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 3
A sensor hub is a common connection point for multiple
sensors that accumulate and forward sensor data to the processing
unit of a device. Actuators can also intervene to change the
physical conditions that generate the data. An actuator might, for
example, shut off a power supply, adjust an airflow valve, or
move a robotic gripper in an assembly process. Sensors in IoT
devices can be classified into three broad categories as described
below:
A. Motion Sensors: Motion sensors measure the change
in motion as well as the orientation of the devices. There are two
types of motions one can observe in a device: linear and angular
motions. The linear motion refers to the linear displacement of an
IoT device while the angular motion refers to the rotational
displacement of the device.
B. Environmental Sensors: Sensors such as Light
sensors, Pressure sensors, etc. are embedded in IoT devices to
sense the change in environmental parameters in the device’s
peripheral. The primary purpose of using environmental sensors
in IoT devices is to help the devices to take autonomous decisions
according to the changes of a device’s peripheral. For instance, environment sensors are used in many
applications to improve user experience (e.g., home automation systems, smart locks, smart lights, etc.).
C. Position sensors: Position sensors of IoT devices deal with the physical position and location of
the device. The most common position sensors used in IoT devices are magnetic sensors and Global
Positioning System (GPS) sensors. Magnetic sensors are usually used as digital compass and help to fix the
orientation of the device display. On the other hand, GPS is used for navigation purposes in IoT devices.
2. Network Layer - The network layer acts as a communication channel to transfer data, collected
in the sensing layer, to other connected devices. In IoT devices, the network layer is implemented by using
diverse communication technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, ZWave, LoRa, cellular network,
etc.) to allow data flow between other devices within the same network.
3. Data Processing Layer - The data processing layer consists of the main data processing unit of
IoT devices. The data processing layer takes data collected in the sensing layer and analyses the data to
make decisions based on the result. In some IoT devices (e.g., smartwatch, smart home hub, etc.), the data
processing layer also saves the result of the previous analysis to improve the user experience. This layer
may share the result of data processing with other connected devices via the network layer.
4. Application Layer - The application layer implements and presents the results of the data
processing layer to accomplish disparate applications of IoT devices. The application layer is a user-centric
layer that executes various tasks for the users. There exist diverse IoT applications, which include smart
transportation, smart home, personal care, healthcare, etc.
Devices and Networks
Connected devices are part of a scenario in which every device talks to other related devices in an
environment to automate home and industrial tasks, and to communicate usable sensor data to users,
businesses and other interested parties. IoT devices are meant to work in concert for people at home, in
industry or in the enterprise. As such, the devices can be categorized into three main groups: consumer,
enterprise and industrial.
Consumer connected devices include smart TVs, smart speakers, toys, wearables, and smart
appliances. smart meters, commercial security systems and smart city technologies such as those used to
monitor traffic and weather conditions are examples of industrial and enterprise IoT devices. Other
technologies, including smart air conditioning, smart thermostats, smart lighting, and smart security, span
home, enterprise, and industrial uses. In the enterprise, smart sensors located in a conference room can help
an employee locate and schedule an available room for a meeting, ensuring the proper room type, size and
features are available. When meeting attendees enter the room, the temperature will adjust according to the
occupancy, and the lights will dim as the appropriate PowerPoint loads on the screen and the speaker begins
his presentation.
IoT network typically includes a number of devices with constrained resources (power, processing,
memory, among others) and some of those devices may be massively deployed over large areas like smart
cities, industrial plants, whereas others may be deployed in hard-to-reach areas like pipelines hazardous
zones, or even in hostile environments like war zones. Therefore, the efficient management of IoT networks
requires considering both the constraints of low power IoT devices and the deployment complexity of the
underlying communication infrastructure. IoT landscape is depicted by an increasing number of connected

WEEK 4 – INTERNET OF THINGS

APPLICATIONS DEV’T & EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES BS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 3
devices characterized by their heterogeneity and the presence of resources constrained networks. To ensure
the correct functioning of those connected devices, they must be remotely accessed to configure, monitoring
their status, and so forth. Traditional management solutions cannot be used for low power devices networks
given their resources limitation and scalability issues. Therefore, efficient and autonomic management of
IoT networks is needed. Developing an IoT network management solution is not an easy task because of
the intrinsic constraints of IoT networks (architecture, technologies, physical layer).
Indeed, it is necessary to take into account several elements such as scalability, interoperability,
energy efficiency, topology control, Quality of Service (QoS), fault tolerance, and security. The security,
context-aware, and the standard model of messages still in an early stage and should be resolved in a new
management platform. Therefore, this work proposes a platform for IoT networks and devices management,
called M4DN.IoT (Management for Device and Network in the Internet of Things). This solution integrates
and controls the individual functionalities of the devices in an IoT network as well as the status and
characteristics of this network. M4DN. IoT defines a management structure in two scopes: local
management, where the platform runs in the same environment as the devices, and remote management,
where the platform controls the devices in different networks.
The structure of the platform is expandable, allowing the addition of new types of network devices
or applications. In addition, the platform provides standard web services, such as device discovery, data
storage, and user authorities, which are basic requirements for creating IoT applications.

IoT Tools and Platforms
There are many vendors in the industrial IoT platform marketplace, offering remarkably similar
capabilities and methods of deployment. These IoT Platform Solutions are based on the Internet of Things
and cloud technology. They can be used in areas of smart home, city, enterprise, home automation,
healthcare or automotive, just to name a few.

Applications of IoT

The versatile nature of IoT makes it an attractive option for so many businesses,
organizations, and government branches, that it doesn’t make sense to ignore it. Here’s a sample of various
industries, and how IoT can be best applied.

• Agriculture - For indoor planting, IoT makes monitoring and management of micro-
climate conditions a reality, which in turn increases production. For outside planting, devices using IoT

technology can sense soil moisture and nutrients, in conjunction with weather data, better control smart
irrigation and fertilizer systems. If the sprinkler systems dispense water only when needed, for example,
this prevents wasting a precious resource.

• Consumer Use - For private citizens, IoT devices in the form of wearables and smart
homes make life easier. Wearables cover accessories such as Fitbit, smartphones, Apple watches, health
monitors, to name a few. These devices improve entertainment, network connectivity, health, and fitness.
Smart homes take care of things like activating environmental controls so that your house is at peak comfort
when you come home. Dinner that requires either an oven or a crockpot can be started remotely, so the food
is ready when you arrive. Security is made more accessible as well, with the consumer having the ability to
control appliances and lights remotely, as well as activating a smart lock to allow the appropriate people to
enter the house even if they don’t have a key.

• Healthcare - First and foremost, wearable IoT devices let hospitals monitor their
patients’ health at home, thereby reducing hospital stays while still providing up to the minute real-time
information that could save lives. In hospitals, smart beds keep the staff informed as to the availability,
thereby cutting wait time for free space. Putting IoT sensors on critical equipment means fewer breakdowns
and increased reliability, which can mean the difference between life and death. Elderly care becomes
significantly more comfortable with IoT. In addition to the above-mentioned real-time home monitoring,
sensors can also determine if a patient has fallen or is suffering a heart attack.

• Insurance - Even the insurance industry can benefit from the IoT revolution. Insurance
companies can offer their policyholders discounts for IoT wearables such as Fitbit. By employing fitness
tracking, the insurer can offer customized policies and encourage healthier habits, which in the long run
benefits everyone, insurer, and customer alike.

• Manufacturing - The world of manufacturing and industrial automation is another big

winner in the IoT sweepstakes. RFID and GPS technology can help a manufacturer track a product from its
start on the factory floor to its placement in the destination store, the whole supply chain from start to finish.
These sensors can gather information on travel time, product condition, and environmental conditions that
the product was subjected to. Sensors attached to factory equipment can help identify bottlenecks in the
production line, thereby reducing lost time and waste. Other sensors mounted on those same machines can
also track the performance of the machine, predicting when the unit will require maintenance,
thereby preventing costly breakdowns.

• Retail - IoT technology has a lot to offer the world of retail. Online and in-store shopping
sales figures can control warehouse automation and robotics, information gleaned from IoT sensors. Much
of this relies on RFIDs, which are already in heavy use worldwide. Mall locations are iffy things; business
tends to fluctuate, and the advent of online shopping has driven down the demand for brick and mortar
establishments. However, IoT can help analyze mall traffic so that stores located in malls can make the
necessary adjustments that enhance the customer’s shopping experience while reducing overhead. Speaking
of customer engagement, IoT helps retailers target customers based on past purchases. Equipped with the
information provided through IoT, a retailer could craft a personalized promotion for their loyal customers,
thereby eliminating the need for costly massmarketing promotions that don’t stand as much of a chance
of success. Much of these promotions can be conducted through the customers’ smartphones, especially if
they have an app for the appropriate store.

• Transportation - By this time, most people have heard about the progress being made
with self-driving cars. But that’s just one bit of the vast potential in the field of transportation. The GPS,
which if you think of it is another example of IoT, is being utilized to help transportation companies plot
faster and more efficient routes for trucks hauling freight, thereby speeding up delivery times. There’s
already significant progress made in navigation, once again alluding to a phone or car’s GPS. But city
planners can also use that data to help determine traffic patterns, parking space demand, and road
construction and maintenance.

• Utilities - IoT sensors can be employed to monitor environmental conditions such as
humidity, temperature, and lighting. The information provided by IoT sensors can aid in the creation of
algorithms that regulate energy usage and make the appropriate adjustments, eliminating the human
equation (and let’s face it, who of us hasn’t forgotten to switch off lights in a room or turn down the
thermostat?). With IoT-driven environmental control, businesses and private residences can experience
significant energy savings, which in the long run, benefits everyone, including the environment! On a larger
scale, data gathered by the Internet of Things can be used to help run municipal power grids more
efficiently, analyzing factors such as usage. In addition, the sensors can help pinpoint outages faster, thereby
increasing the response time of repair crews and decreasing blackout times.
IoT Based Smart Home

Smart Home initiative allows subscribers to remotely manage and monitor different home
devices from anywhere via smartphones or over the web with no physical distance limitations. With the
ongoing development of mass-deployed broadband internet connectivity and wireless technology, the
concept of a Smart Home has become a reality where all devices are integrated and interconnected via the
wireless network. These “smart” devices have the potential to share information with each other given the
permanent availability to access the broadband internet connection.
