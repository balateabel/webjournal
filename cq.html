                        7.4. Cloud and Quantum Computing
7.4.1. Cloud Computing
What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources—applications,
servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, networking
capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed by a cloud services provider
(or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them
according to usage.
Compared to traditional on-premises IT, and depending on the cloud services you select, cloud
computing helps do the following:
 Lower IT costs: Cloud lets you offload some or most of the costs and effort of
purchasing, installing, configuring, and managing your own on-premises infrastructure.
 Improve agility and time-to-value: With the cloud, your organization can start using
enterprise applications in minutes, instead of waiting weeks or months for IT to respond
to a request, purchase and configure supporting hardware, and install the software.
Cloud also lets you empower certain users—specifically developers and data
scientists—to help themselves to software and support infrastructure.
 Scale more easily and cost-effectively: Cloud provides elasticity—instead of purchasing
excess capacity that sits unused during slow periods, you can scale capacity up and
down in response to spikes and dips in traffic. You can also take advantage of your cloud
provider’s global network to spread your applications closer to users around the world.
The term ‘cloud computing’ also refers to the technology that makes cloud work. This includes
some form of virtualized IT infrastructure—servers, operating system software, networking, and
other infrastructure that’s abstracted, using special software, so that it can be pooled and
divided irrespective of physical hardware boundaries. For example, a single hardware server
can be divided into multiple virtual servers.
Virtualization enables cloud providers to make maximum use of their data center resources.
Not surprisingly, many corporations have adopted the cloud delivery model for their on-
premises infrastructure so they can realize maximum utilization and cost savings vs.
traditional IT infrastructure and offer the same self-service and agility to their end-users.
If you use a computer or mobile device at home or at work, you almost certainly use some form
of cloud computing every day, whether it’s a cloud application like Google Gmail or Salesforce,
streaming media like Netflix, or cloud file storage like Dropbox. Industry analyst Gartner

recently projected that worldwide end-user public cloud spending will reach nearly USD 600
billion in 2023 (link resides outside ibm.com).

Cloud computing services
IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and SaaS (Software-as-a-
Service) are the three most common models of cloud services, and it’s not uncommon for an
organization to use all three.
SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
SaaS—also known as cloud-based software or cloud applications—is application software that’s
hosted in the cloud, and that users access via a web browser, a dedicated desktop client, or an
API that integrates with a desktop or mobile operating system. In most cases, SaaS users pay a
monthly or annual subscription fee; some may offer ‘pay-as-you-go’ pricing based on your
actual usage.
In addition to the cost savings, time-to-value, and scalability benefits of cloud, SaaS offers the
following:
 Automatic upgrades: With SaaS, users take advantage of new features as soon as the
provider adds them, without having to orchestrate an on-premises upgrade.
 Protection from data loss: Because SaaS stores application data in the cloud with the
application, users don’t lose data if their device crashes or breaks.
SaaS is the primary delivery model for most commercial software today—there are hundreds of
thousands of SaaS solutions available, from the most focused industry and departmental
applications, to powerful enterprise software database and AI (artificial intelligence) software.
PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)
PaaS provides software developers with on-demand platform—hardware, complete software
stack, infrastructure, and even development tools—for running, developing, and managing
applications without the cost, complexity, and inflexibility of maintaining that platform on-
premises.
With PaaS, the cloud provider hosts everything—servers, networks, storage, operating
system software, middleware, databases—at their data center. Developers simply pick from a
menu to ‘spin up’ servers and environments they need to run, build, test, deploy, maintain,
update, and scale applications.

Today, PaaS is often built around containers, a virtualized compute model one step removed
from virtual servers. Containers virtualize the operating system, enabling developers to package
the application with only the operating system services it needs to run on any platform, without
modification and without need for middleware.
Red Hat OpenShift is a popular PaaS built around Docker containers and Kubernetes, an open
source container orchestration solution that automates deployment, scaling, load balancing,
and more for container-based applications.
IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)
IaaS provides on-demand access to fundamental computing resources—physical and virtual
servers, networking, and storage—over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. IaaS enables end
users to scale and shrink resources on an as-needed basis, reducing the need for high, up-front
capital expenditures or unnecessary on-premises or ‘owned’ infrastructure and for overbuying
resources to accommodate periodic spikes in usage.  
In contrast to SaaS and PaaS (and even newer PaaS computing models such as containers and
serverless), IaaS provides the users with the lowest-level control of computing resources in the
cloud.
IaaS was the most popular cloud computing model when it emerged in the early 2010s. While it
remains the cloud model for many types of workloads, use of SaaS and PaaS is growing at a
much faster rate.
Serverless computing 
Serverless computing (also called simply serverless) is a cloud computing model that offloads all
the backend infrastructure management tasks–provisioning, scaling, scheduling, patching—to
the cloud provider, freeing developers to focus all their time and effort on the code and
business logic specific to their applications.
What&#39;s more, serverless runs application code on a per-request basis only and scales the
supporting infrastructure up and down automatically in response to the number of requests.
With serverless, customers pay only for the resources being used when the application is
running—they never pay for idle capacity. 
FaaS, or Function-as-a-Service, is often confused with serverless computing when, in fact, it&#39;s a
subset of serverless. FaaS allows developers to execute portions of application code (called
functions) in response to specific events. Everything besides the code—physical
hardware, virtual machine operating system, and web server software management—is
provisioned automatically by the cloud service provider in real time as the code executes and is
spun back down once the execution completes. Billing starts when execution starts and stops
when execution stops.

Types of cloud computing
Public Cloud
Public cloud is a type of cloud computing in which a cloud service provider makes computing
resources—anything from SaaS applications, to individual virtual machines (VMs), to bare metal
computing hardware, to complete enterprise-grade infrastructures and development
platforms—available to users over the public internet. These resources might be accessible for
free, or access might be sold according to subscription-based or pay-per-usage pricing models.
The public cloud provider owns, manages, and assumes all responsibility for the data centers,
hardware, and infrastructure on which its customers’ workloads run, and it typically provides
high-bandwidth network connectivity to ensure high performance and rapid access to
applications and data.
Public cloud is a multi-tenant environment—the cloud provider&#39;s data center infrastructure is
shared by all public cloud customers. In the leading public clouds—Amazon Web Services
(AWS), Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud—those customers can
number in the millions.
Many enterprises are moving portions of their computing infrastructure to the public cloud
because public cloud services are elastic and readily scalable, flexibly adjusting to meet
changing workload demands. Others are attracted by the promise of greater efficiency and
fewer wasted resources since customers pay only for what they use. Still others seek to reduce
spending on hardware and on-premises infrastructures.
Private cloud
Private cloud is a cloud environment in which all cloud infrastructure and computing resources
are dedicated to, and accessible by, one customer only. Private cloud combines many of the
benefits of cloud computing—including elasticity, scalability, and ease of service delivery—with
the access control, security, and resource customization of on-premises infrastructure.
A private cloud is typically hosted on-premises in the customer&#39;s data center. But a private
cloud can also be hosted on an independent cloud provider’s infrastructure or built on rented
infrastructure housed in an offsite data center.
Many companies choose private cloud over public cloud because private cloud is an easier way
(or the only way) to meet their regulatory compliance requirements. Others choose private
cloud because their workloads deal with confidential documents, intellectual property,
personally identifiable information (PII), medical records, financial data, or other sensitive data.

By building private cloud architecture according to cloud native principles, an organization gives
itself the flexibility to easily move workloads to public cloud or run them within a hybrid
cloud (see below) environment whenever they’re ready.
Hybrid cloud
Hybrid cloud is just what it sounds like—a combination of public and private cloud
environments. Specifically, and ideally, a hybrid cloud connects an organization&#39;s private cloud
services and public clouds into a single, flexible infrastructure for running the organization’s
applications and workloads.
The goal of hybrid cloud is to establish a mix of public and private cloud resources—and with a
level of orchestration between them—that gives an organization the flexibility to choose the
optimal cloud for each application or workload and to move workloads freely between the two
clouds as circumstances change. This enables the organization to meet its technical and
business objectives more effectively and cost-efficiently than it could with public or private
cloud alone.
Multicloud and hybrid multicloud
Multicloud is the use of two or more clouds from two or more different cloud providers. Having
a multicloud environment can be as simple using email SaaS from one vendor and image editing
SaaS from another. But when enterprises talk about multicloud, they&#39;re typically talking about
using multiple cloud services—including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services—from two or more of the
leading public cloud providers.
Hybrid multicloud is the use of two or more public clouds together with a private cloud
environment.
Organizations choose multicloud to avoid vendor lock-in, to have more services to choose from,
and to access to more innovation. But the more clouds you use—each with its own set of
management tools, data transmission rates, and security protocols—the more difficult it can be
to manage your environment. Multicloud management platforms provide visibility across
multiple provider clouds through a central dashboard, where development teams can see their
projects and deployments, operations teams can keep an eye on clusters and nodes, and the
cybersecurity staff can monitor for threats.

Cloud security
Traditionally, security concerns have been the primary obstacle for organizations
considering cloud services, particularly public cloud services. In response to demand, however,
the security offered by cloud service providers is steadily outstripping on-premises security
solutions.
Maintaining cloud security demands different procedures and employee skillsets than in legacy
IT environments. Some cloud security best practices include the following:
 Shared responsibility for security: Generally, the cloud provider is responsible for
securing cloud infrastructure and the customer is responsible for protecting its data
within the cloud—but it&#39;s also important to clearly define data ownership between
private and public third parties.
 Data encryption: Data should be encrypted while at rest, in transit, and in use.
Customers need to maintain full control over security keys and hardware security
module.
 User identity and access management: Customer and IT teams need full understanding
of and visibility into network, device, application, and data access.
 Collaborative management: Proper communication and clear, understandable
processes between IT, operations, and security teams will ensure seamless cloud
integrations that are secure and sustainable.
 Security and compliance monitoring: This begins with understanding all regulatory
compliance standards applicable to your industry and setting up active monitoring of all
connected systems and cloud-based services to maintain visibility of all data exchanges
between public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.

Cloud use cases
With 25% of organizations planning to move all their applications to cloud within the next year,
it would seem that cloud computing use cases are limitless. But even for companies not
planning a wholesale shift to the cloud, certain initiatives and cloud computing are a match
made in IT heaven.
Disaster recovery and business continuity have always been a natural for cloud because cloud
provides cost-effective redundancy to protect data against system failures and the physical
distance required to recover data and applications in the event of a local outage or disaster. All
of the major public cloud providers offer Disaster-Recovery-as-a-Service (DRaaS).
Anything that involves storing and processing huge volumes of data at high speeds—and
requires more storage and computing capacity than most organizations can or want to
purchase and deploy on-premises—is a target for cloud computing. Examples include:
 Big data analytics
 Internet of Things (IoT)
 Artificial intelligence—particularly machine learning and deep learning applications
For development teams adopting Agile or DevOps (or  DevSecOps ) to streamline development,
cloud offers the on-demand end-user self-service that keeps operations tasks—such as spinning
up development and test servers—from becoming development bottlenecks. 

7.4.2. The Advantages of cloud computing?
Flexibility
Users can scale services to fit their needs, customize applications and access cloud services
from anywhere with an internet connection.
 Scalability: Cloud infrastructure scales on demand to support fluctuating workloads.
 Storage options: Users can choose public, private, or hybrid storage offerings,
depending on security needs and other considerations.
 Control choices: Organizations can determine their level of control with as-a-service
options. These include Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS),
and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).
 Tool selection: Users can select from a menu of prebuilt tools and features to build a
solution that fits their specific needs.
 Security features: Virtual private cloud, encryption, and API keys help keep data secure.

Efficiency
Enterprise users can get applications to market quickly, without worrying about underlying
infrastructure costs or maintenance.
 Accessibility: Cloud-based applications and data are accessible from virtually any
internet-connected device.
 Speed to market: Developing in the cloud enables users to get their applications to
market quickly.
 Data security: Hardware failures do not result in data loss because of networked
backups.
 Savings on equipment: Cloud computing uses remote resources, saving organizations
the cost of servers and other equipment.
 Pay structure: A “utility” pay structure means users only pay for the resources they use.

Strategic value
 Streamlined work: Cloud service providers (CSPs) manage underlying infrastructure,
enabling organizations to focus on application development and other priorities.
 Regular updates: Service providers regularly update offerings to give users the most up-
to-date technology.
 Collaboration: Worldwide access means teams can collaborate from widespread
locations.
 Competitive edge: Organizations can move more nimbly than competitors who must
devote IT resources to managing infrastructure.

7.4.3. What is quantum computing?
Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of
quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers. 
Today, IBM Quantum makes real quantum hardware -- a tool scientists only began to imagine
three decades ago -- available to hundreds of thousands of developers. Our engineers deliver
ever-more-powerful superconducting quantum processors at regular intervals, alongside crucial
advances in software and quantum-classical orchestration. This work drives toward the
quantum computing speed and capacity necessary to change the world. 
These machines are very different from the classical computers that have been around for
more than half a century. Here&#39;s a primer on this transformative technology.
How do quantum computers work?
Quantum computers are elegant machines, smaller and requiring less energy than
supercomputers. An IBM Quantum processor is a wafer not much bigger than the one found in
a laptop. And a quantum hardware system is about the size of a car, made up mostly of cooling
systems to keep the superconducting processor at its ultra-cold operational temperature.
A classical processor uses bits to perform its operations. A quantum computer uses qubits (CUE-
bits) to run multidimensional quantum algorithms.

Superfluids
Your desktop computer likely uses a fan to get cold enough to work. Our quantum
processors need to be very cold – about a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero. To
achieve this, we use super-cooled superfluids to create superconductors.
Superconductors
At those ultra-low temperatures certain materials in our processors exhibit another
important quantum mechanical effect: electrons move through them without resistance. This
makes them &quot;superconductors.&quot; 
When electrons pass through superconductors they match up, forming &quot;Cooper pairs.&quot;
These pairs can carry a charge across barriers, or insulators, through a process known as
quantum tunneling. Two superconductors placed on either side of an insulator form a
Josephson junction.
Control
Our quantum computers use Josephson junctions as superconducting qubits. By firing
microwave photons at these qubits, we can control their behavior and get them to hold,
change, and read out individual units of quantum information.
Superposition
A qubit itself isn&#39;t very useful. But it can perform an important trick: placing the
quantum information it holds into a state of superposition, which represents a combination of
all possible configurations of the qubit. Groups of qubits in superposition can create complex,
multidimensional computational spaces. Complex problems can be represented in new ways in
these spaces.
Entanglement
Entanglement is a quantum mechanical effect that correlates the behavior of two
separate things. When two qubits are entangled, changes to one qubit directly impact the
other. Quantum algorithms leverage those relationships to find solutions to complex problems.

Why do we need quantum computers?
For some problems, supercomputers aren’t that super.
When scientists and engineers encounter difficult problems, they turn to supercomputers.
These are very large classical computers, often with thousands of classical CPU and GPU cores.
However, even supercomputers struggle to solve certain kinds of problems.
If a supercomputer gets stumped, that&#39;s probably because the big classical machine was asked
to solve a problem with a high degree of complexity. When classical computers fail, it&#39;s often
due to complexity
Complex problems are problems with lots of variables interacting in complicated ways.
Modeling the behavior of individual atoms in a molecule is a complex problem, because of all
the different electrons interacting with one another. Sorting out the ideal routes for a few
hundred tankers in a global shipping network is complex too.

7.4.4. Advantages of quantum computing
Quantum computing has several potential advantages over classical computing. Here are some
of the most significant advantages:
1. Faster computation: Quantum computers can solve certain types of problems much
faster than classical computers. This is because quantum computers use qubits, which
can exist in multiple states at once, allowing them to perform many calculations
simultaneously. Some problems that would take billions of years for classical computers
to solve can be solved in seconds or minutes on a quantum computer.
2. Improved encryption: Quantum computers can break many of the encryption methods
currently used in digital communication. However, they can also be used to develop
new, more secure methods of encryption that would be nearly impossible to break
using classical computing methods.
3. Better optimization: Many real-world problems involve finding the best solution among
a large number of possibilities. Quantum computers can perform optimization tasks
much more efficiently than classical computers, allowing for more accurate and
effective solutions to complex problems.
4. More accurate simulations: Quantum computers can simulate quantum systems much
more accurately than classical computers. This is because classical computers must
simulate each possible state of a system one at a time, while quantum computers can
simulate all possible states simultaneously.

5. Improved machine learning: Quantum computing can be used to improve machine
learning algorithms, allowing for more accurate predictions and faster data analysis.
Overall, quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize many industries and fields, from
finance and healthcare to climate science and cryptography.

7.5 Autonomic Computing
Autonomic computing is a computer’s ability to manage itself automatically through adaptive
technologies that further computing capabilities and cut down on the time required by
computer professionals to resolve system difficulties and other maintenance such as software
updates.
The move toward autonomic computing is driven by a desire for cost reduction and the need to
lift the obstacles presented by computer system complexities to allow for more advanced
computing technology.
The autonomic computing initiative (ACI), which was developed by IBM, demonstrates and
advocates networking computer systems that do not involve a lot of human intervention
other than defining input rules. The ACI is derived from the autonomic nervous system of the
human body.

IBM has defined the four areas of automatic computing:

 Self-Configuration.
 Self-Healing (error correction).
 Self-Optimization (automatic resource control for optimal functioning).
 Self-Protection (identification and protection from attacks in a proactive manner).
Characteristics that every autonomic computing system should have include automation,
adaptivity and awareness.
AC was designed to mimic the human body’s nervous system-in that the autonomic nervous
system acts and reacts to stimuli independent of the individual’s conscious input-an autonomic
computing environment functions with a high level of artificial intelligence while remaining
invisible to the users. Just as the human body acts and responds without the individual
controlling functions (e.g., internal temperature rises and falls, breathing rate fluctuates, glands
secrete hormones in response to stimulus), the autonomic computing environment operates
organically in response to the input it collects.

IBM has set forth eight conditions that define an autonomic system:

1. The system must know itself in terms of what resources it has access to, what its
capabilities and limitations are and how and why it is connected to other systems.
2. The system must be able to automatically configure and reconfigure itself depending on
the changing computing environment.
3. The system must be able to optimize its performance to ensure the most efficient
computing process.
4. The system must be able to work around encountered problems by either repairing
itself or routing functions away from the trouble.
5. The system must detect, identify and protect itself against various types of attacks to
maintain overall system security and integrity.
6. The system must be able to adapt to its environment as it changes, interacting with
neighboring systems and establishing communication protocols.
7. The system must rely on open standards and cannot exist in a proprietary environment.
8. The system must anticipate the demand on its resources while keeping transparent to
users.
Autonomic computing is one of the building blocks of pervasive computing, an anticipated
future computing model in which tiny – even invisible – computers will be all around us,
communicating through increasingly interconnected networks leading to the concept of The
Internet of Everything (IoE). Many industry leaders are researching various components of
autonomic computing.

7.5.1. Characteristics of Autonomic Computing
Autonomic computing is a type of computing system that is designed to be self-managing and
self-healing. Here are some of the key characteristics of autonomic computing:
1. Self-configuration: Autonomic computing systems are designed to automatically
configure themselves based on their environment and the tasks they are expected to
perform. This includes automatically setting up hardware and software components, as
well as optimizing system performance.
2. Self-optimization: Autonomic computing systems are able to monitor their own
performance and adjust their operations to improve efficiency and achieve better
results. This includes adjusting resource allocation, load balancing, and other system
parameters to optimize system performance.

3. Self-protection: Autonomic computing systems are designed to automatically detect and
respond to security threats and other potential problems. This includes monitoring
system logs, detecting anomalies, and taking corrective actions to prevent or mitigate
security breaches and other types of failures.
4. Self-healing: Autonomic computing systems are able to detect and recover from system
failures without human intervention. This includes automatically identifying and
isolating faulty components, restoring service to healthy components, and restarting
failed processes or services.
Overall, the characteristics of autonomic computing are designed to make computing systems
more resilient, reliable, and efficient, while reducing the need for manual intervention and
management.
7.6. Computer Vision
7.6.1. History
Scientists and engineers have been trying to develop ways for machines to see and
understand visual data for about 60 years. Experimentation began in 1959 when
neurophysiologists showed a cat an array of images, attempting to correlate a response in its
brain. They discovered that it responded first to hard edges or lines, and scientifically, this
meant that image processing starts with simple shapes like straight edges.
At about the same time, the first computer image scanning technology was developed, enabling
computers to digitize and acquire images. Another milestone was reached in 1963 when
computers were able to transform two-dimensional images into three-dimensional forms. In
the 1960s, AI emerged as an academic field of study, and it also marked the beginning of the AI
quest to solve the human vision problem.
1974 saw the introduction of optical character recognition (OCR) technology, which could
recognize text printed in any font or typeface.   Similarly, intelligent character recognition (ICR)
could decipher hand-written text using neural networks. Since then, OCR and ICR have found
their way into document and invoice processing, vehicle plate recognition, mobile payments,
machine translation and other common applications.
In 1982, neuroscientist David Marr established that vision works hierarchically and introduced
algorithms for machines to detect edges, corners, curves and similar basic shapes.
Concurrently, computer scientist Kunihiko Fukushima developed a network of cells that could
recognize patterns. The network, called the Neocognitron, included convolutional layers in a
neural network.
By 2000, the focus of study was on object recognition, and by 2001, the first real-time face
recognition applications appeared. Standardization of how visual data sets are tagged and

annotated emerged through the 2000s. In 2010, the ImageNet data set became available. It
contained millions of tagged images across a thousand object classes and provides a foundation
for CNNs and deep learning models used today. In 2012, a team from the University of Toronto
entered a CNN into an image recognition contest. The model, called AlexNet, significantly
reduced the error rate for image recognition. After this breakthrough, error rates have fallen to
just a few percent.
7.6.2. Definition
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and
systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs —
and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers
to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start.
Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far
away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.
Computer vision trains machines to perform these functions, but it has to do it in much less
time with cameras, data and algorithms rather than retinas, optic nerves and a visual cortex.
Because a system trained to inspect products or watch a production asset can analyze
thousands of products or processes a minute, noticing imperceptible defects or issues, it can
quickly surpass human capabilities.
Computer vision is used in industries ranging from energy and utilities to manufacturing and
automotive – and the market is continuing to grow. It is expected to reach USD 48.6 billion by
2022.
7.6.3. How computer Vision Work
Computer vision needs lots of data. It runs analyses of data over and over until it
discerns distinctions and ultimately recognize images. For example, to train a computer to
recognize automobile tires, it needs to be fed vast quantities of tire images and tire-related
items to learn the differences and recognize a tire, especially one with no defects.
Two essential technologies are used to accomplish this: a type of machine learning called deep
learning and a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Machine learning uses algorithmic models that enable a computer to teach itself about the
context of visual data. If enough data is fed through the model, the computer will “look” at the
data and teach itself to tell one image from another. Algorithms enable the machine to learn by
itself, rather than someone programming it to recognize an image.

A CNN helps a machine learning or deep learning model “look” by breaking images down into
pixels that are given tags or labels. It uses the labels to perform convolutions (a mathematical
operation on two functions to produce a third function) and makes predictions about what it is
“seeing.” The neural network runs convolutions and checks the accuracy of its predictions in a
series of iterations until the predictions start to come true. It is then recognizing or seeing
images in a way similar to humans.
Much like a human making out an image at a distance, a CNN first discerns hard edges and
simple shapes, then fills in information as it runs iterations of its predictions. A CNN is used to
understand single images. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is used in a similar way for video
applications to help computers understand how pictures in a series of frames are related to one
another.

7.6.4. Applications of Computer Vision
There is a lot of research being done in the computer vision field, but it’s not just research.
Real-world applications demonstrate how important computer vision is to endeavors in
business, entertainment, transportation, healthcare and everyday life. A key driver for the
growth of these applications is the flood of visual information flowing from smartphones,
security systems, traffic cameras and other visually instrumented devices. This data could play a
major role in operations across industries, but today goes unused. The information creates a
test bed to train computer vision applications and a launchpad for them to become part of a
range of human activities:
 IBM used computer vision to create My Moments for the 2018 Masters golf
tournament. IBM Watson watched hundreds of hours of Masters footage and could
identify the sights (and sounds) of significant shots. It curated these key moments and
delivered them to fans as personalized highlight reels.
 Google Translate lets users point a smartphone camera at a sign in another language
and almost immediately obtain a translation of the sign in their preferred language.
 The development of self-driving vehicles relies on computer vision to make sense of the
visual input from a car’s cameras and other sensors. It’s essential to identify other cars,
traffic signs, lane markers, pedestrians, bicycles and all of the other visual information
encountered on the road.
 IBM is applying computer vision technology with partners like Verizon to bring
intelligent AI to the edge, and to help automotive manufacturers identify quality defects
before a vehicle leaves the factory.

Computer vision examples

Many organizations don’t have the resources to fund computer vision labs and create
deep learning models and neural networks. They may also lack the computing power required
to process huge sets of visual data. Companies such as IBM are helping by offering computer
vision software development services. These services deliver pre-built learning models available
from the cloud — and also ease demand on computing resources. Users connect to the services
through an application programming interface (API) and use them to develop computer vision
applications.
IBM has also introduced a computer vision platform that addresses both developmental and
computing resource concerns. IBM Maximo Visual Inspection includes tools that enable subject
matter experts to label, train and deploy deep learning vision models — without coding or deep
learning expertise. The vision models can be deployed in local data centers, the cloud and edge
devices.
While it’s getting easier to obtain resources to develop computer vision applications, an
important question to answer early on is: What exactly will these applications do?
Understanding and defining specific computer vision tasks can focus and validate projects and
applications and make it easier to get started.
Here are a few examples of established computer vision tasks:
 Image classification sees an image and can classify it (a dog, an apple, a person’s face).
More precisely, it is able to accurately predict that a given image belongs to a certain
class. For example, a social media company might want to use it to automatically
identify and segregate objectionable images uploaded by users.
 Object detection can use image classification to identify a certain class of image and
then detect and tabulate their appearance in an image or video. Examples include
detecting damages on an assembly line or identifying machinery that requires
maintenance.
 Object tracking follows or tracks an object once it is detected. This task is often
executed with images captured in sequence or real-time video feeds. Autonomous
vehicles, for example, need to not only classify and detect objects such as pedestrians,
other cars and road infrastructure, they need to track them in motion to avoid collisions
and obey traffic laws.
 Content-based image retrieval uses computer vision to browse, search and retrieve
images from large data stores, based on the content of the images rather than metadata
tags associated with them. This task can incorporate automatic image annotation that
replaces manual image tagging. These tasks can be used for digital asset
management systems and can increase the accuracy of search and retrieval.
