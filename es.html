                    An embedded system is a combination of computer hardware and software designed for a 
                    specific function. Embedded systems
                     may also function within a larger system. The systems can be programmable or have a 
                     fixed functionality. 
                     Industrial machines, consumer electronics, agricultural and processing industry
                      devices, automobiles, medical
                      equipment, cameras, digital watches, household appliances, airplanes, vending 
                      machines and toys, as well as 
                      mobile devices, are possible locations for an embedded system.

While embedded systems are computing systems, they can range from having no user interface (UI) -- for example, on 
devices designed 
to perform a single task -- to complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs), such as in mobile devices. User interfaces
 can include buttons, LEDs (light-emitting diodes) and touchscreen sensing. Some systems use remote user interfaces
  as well.

MarketsandMarkets, a business-to-business (B2B) research firm, predicted that the embedded market will be worth
 $116.2 billion by 2025. Chip manufacturers for embedded systems include many well-known technology companies, 
 such as Apple, IBM, Intel and Texas Instruments. The expected growth is partially due to the continued investment
  in artificial intelligence (AI), mobile computing and the need for chips designed for high-level processing.

Examples of embedded systems
Embedded systems are used in a wide range of technologies across an array of industries. Some examples include:

Automobiles. Modern cars commonly consist of many computers (sometimes as many as 100), or embedded systems, 
designed to perform different tasks within the vehicle. Some of these systems perform basic utility functions 
and others provide entertainment or user-facing functions. Some embedded systems in consumer vehicles include
 cruise control, backup sensors, suspension control, navigation systems and airbag systems.
Mobile phones. These consist of many embedded systems, including GUI software and hardware, operating systems
 (OSes), cameras, microphones, and USB (Universal Serial Bus) I/O (input/output) modules.
Industrial machines. They can contain embedded systems, like sensors, and can be embedded systems themselves.
 Industrial machines often have embedded automation systems that perform specific monitoring and control functions.
Medical equipment. These may contain embedded systems like sensors and control mechanisms. Medical equipment,
 such as industrial machines, also must be very user-friendly so that human health isn't jeopardized by 
 preventable machine mistakes. This means they'll often include a more complex OS and GUI designed for an 
 appropriate UI.
How does an embedded system work?
Embedded systems always function as part of a complete device -- that's what's meant by the term embedded. 
They are low-cost, low-power-consuming, small computers that are embedded in other mechanical or electrical
 systems. Generally, they comprise a processor, power supply, and memory and communication ports.
  Embedded systems use the communication ports to transmit data between the processor and peripheral
   devices -- often, other embedded systems -- using a communication protocol. The processor interprets 
   this data with the help of minimal software stored on the memory. The software is usually highly 
   specific to the function that the embedded system serves.



   Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital 
   attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to 
   combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside
    or outside of an organization.

In 2020, the average cost of a data breach was USD 3.86 million globally, and USD 8.64 million in the
 United States. These costs include the expenses of discovering and responding to the breach, the cost
  of downtime and lost revenue, and the long-term reputational damage to a business and its brand.
   Cybercriminals target customers’ personally identifiable information (PII) — names, addresses, 
   national identification numbers (e.g., Social Security number in the US, fiscal codes in Italy),
    and credit card information — and then sell these records in underground digital marketplaces.
     Compromised PII often leads to a loss of customer trust, the imposition of regulatory fines, 
     and even legal action.

Security system complexity, created by disparate technologies and a lack of in-house expertise, can 
amplify these costs. But organizations with a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, governed by best
 practices and automated using advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning,
  can fight cyberthreats more effectively and reduce the lifecycle and impact of breaches when they occur.


  
The actual process of additive manufacturing can be done in a number of ways, all of which can take 
several hours to several days, depending on the object’s size. One common method uses a nozzle to 
lay successive layers of material on top of each other until the final product is complete.Another
 process uses powders, typically made from metal. This works by “filling a bed with powder, and 
 melting the parts of the powder that you want to form a solid part layer by layer. After you do
  this, all the loose powder falls away from your final part,” Kalidindi said. This is usually done 
  using lasers or electron beams, but another technique involves using a polymer to adhere layers of 
  powder together. The part is then placed in a furnace where the plastic melts away and the powders
   sinter together, forming the final part.

The advantages of additive manufacturing
 
Additive manufacturing has some distinct benefits. With traditional manufacturing, the entire supply
 chain can take months and require an investment — sometimes millions or billions of dollars — that 
 can only be recouped by high-volume production. With additive manufacturing, much of the supply 
 chain’s intermediate steps are removed. “The speed at which you can get to a single part is much 
 faster,” said Roemer, since people can send a design directly from their computer to the 3-D printer.

Manufacturing something additively also makes it possible to create objects with functionally-graded
 materials — meaning they can have different materials on the inside and outside. “Imagine you want
  something that has high conductivity, but also is abrasion resistant,” said Roemer. “On the outside,
   you have the abrasion-resistant materials, like ceramics, and on the inside, you have the 
   conductive materials, like metals. Creating something like that is quite difficult to do with 
   conventional manufacturing.”Roemer believes, though, that the two biggest advantages to additive
    manufacturing are creating complex geometries and producing small lot sizes.“With additive 
    manufacturing, you produce — layer by layer — pretty much any geometry you want to create. 
    You can create 3-D entities that are much more complex and have different material properties,” 
    said Roemer. With subtractive manufacturing, some objects are too small or have too awkward an 
    angle to subtract materials in the desired way. Additive manufacturing eliminates that barrier. 
    This also means that manufacturers can eliminate weight from an object. This is particular 
    important in the aerospace and automobile industries, where weight can affect the functionality
     of a final product.

Additive manufacturing also makes it easier to create small amounts of something. With traditional
 manufacturing, setup costs mean producing small lots is not cost effective. But with additive
  manufacturing, setup costs are mostly eliminated, so creating just a handful of objects becomes
   more reasonable. This makes customizing products, like prosthetics or implants, easier, and
    could result in better outcomes for patients. Hearing aids, which are customized for each 
    person, are almost entirely additively manufactured.
